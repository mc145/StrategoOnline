        <p1 class="how-to-play-par" id="howtoplayparagraph"> Stratego is a war based board game where players move their 
            pieces to attack their opponent's pieces and capture their flag. To set up the game, both players place their pieces
            on their side of the board. Both players have a 10x4 grid to put their 40 pieces. The main point of the game is to put your
            flag in a strategic position so the enemy can not capture it. You also have bombs that are very powerful and can blow up anything that 
            come across it except for the miner as it will mine out the bomb.
