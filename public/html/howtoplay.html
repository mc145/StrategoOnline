        <p1 class="how-to-play-par" id="howtoplayparagraph"> Stratego is a war based board game where players move their 
            pieces to attack their opponent's pieces and capture their flag. To set up the game, both players place their pieces
            on their side of the board. Both players have a 10x4 grid to put their 40 pieces. The main point of the game is to put your
            flag in a strategic position so the enemy can not capture it. You also have bombs that are very powerful and can blow up anything that 
            come across it except for the miner as it will mine out the bomb. The most powerful piece in the game is the marshal and it can take anything piece except for 
            the bombs. All the main pieces are numbered, and all of the numbered pieces have a purpose. 10 is the Marshal, 9 is the General, 8 is the Colonel, 7 is the Major,

            If a numbered piece attacks the opponents piece and if the opponent's pieces' number is lower,

            <li> Bomb: The bomb is a powerful tool that you can place around your side of the board to protect your flag and defend your pieces. Be aware though, the miner is the piece that can dig out these bombs.</li>
